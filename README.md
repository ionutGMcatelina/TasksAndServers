# TasksAndServers
This program simulates the idstribution of tasks at servers.
When you open the application you must complete some fields: number of servers, maxim processing time, minim processing time,
number of tasks and simulation time. every task has an arrive time wich is a number between 1 and simulation time, and at that time the task
will arrive and the program will chose a server for that. This is why the number of tasks must be less that simulation time. Processing time is the
the period in which a task will be processed. When the START button is pressed, another panel will appear. In left is a number of fields
(equal with the number of servers entered at the beginning) where will appear the tasks. The processind time for the server will be there, udated at each second.
In center will be the status for each second and in right there are some statistics.
